# Project Name
Telecom Churn Prediction 


## General Information
The main goal of the case study is to build ML models to predict churn. The predictive model that youâ€™re going to build will the following purposes:

It will be used to predict whether a high-value customer will churn or not, in near future (i.e. churn phase). By knowing this, the company can take action steps such as providing special plans, discounts on recharge etc.

It will be used to identify important variables that are strong predictors of churn. These variables may also indicate why customers choose to switch to other networks.

## Conclusions
The Random Forest model demonstrates superior predictive capability for churn based on accuracy as the performance metric.

Target the customers, whose minutes of usage of the incoming local calls and outgoing calls are less in the action phase (mostly in the month of August).

Target the customers who have good average revenue in the month of August (arpu).
